The documentation consists of:
- A quick user guide ('Quick guide.pdf') explaining briefly step by step how to track filaments 
  in an image and how to compute their mass per length.
- A test image, as used in the quick guide, for the user to follow the steps. 

A more detailed documentation is coming soon!
